The only non-standard python module that I used was Pandas, which allowed me to organize, filter and query the receipt list without persisting any of the data into a database. Effectively, I converted each file to JSON, iterated over the products list and stored each ordered product's information into a dictionary. I then used that dictionary to create a Pandas DataFrame that allowed me to easily sort and filter the data based on the params that the user enters. I found this method of importing data into the Pandas DataFrame to be tremendously quicker than inserting a new row of data for each iteration. I sorted the data using the product's ID instead of the name to avoid any possible duplications that might exist. I added a validation to remove bottle deposits, to go orders and to stay charges, but those can be easily added back into the query.
